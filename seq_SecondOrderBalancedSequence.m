function [S,i]=SecondOrderBalancedSequence(repetition,start_condition)
%[S,i]=SecondOrderBalancedSequence(tItem,repetition,start_condition)
%
%   Generates a so-called t1r1 sequence, see Aguirre for fMRI applications.
%   These sequences are balanced for second-order transitions. 
%   The length of repetition determines the number of conditions, and each
%   value in the repetition vector determines how many times a given
%   transition occurs. For example, a vector [5 5 5 1] means that the
%   sequence contains 5 transitions between conditions 1 to 3 and only 1
%   transition to the 4th condition.
%
%   Note that the total number of elements in the sequence will be
%   TITEM*REPETITION+1, the  +1 is needed to make all  transitions
%   possible. This additional trial can be used as a dummy trial.
%   START_CONDITION indicates the starting condition of the 
%   sequence.
%
%   If REPETITION is a matrix, it is considered as a transition matrix as
%   such. Thus arbitrary shaped transition matrices can be used, please
%   note that not all transition matrices will converge to a solution.
%
%   Example Usage:
%   as a vector:
%   [S,i]=SecondOrderBalancedSequence(ones(1,8)*34,1)
%   as a matrice:
%   m = [1 2 1 2 1;2 1 2 1 2;1 2 1 2 1; 2 1 2 1 2;1 2 1 2 1];;
%   [S,i]=SecondOrderBalancedSequence(m,1);
