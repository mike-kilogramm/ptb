function [S,i]=SecondOrderBalancedSequence(tItem,repetition,start_condition)
%[S,i]=SecondOrderBalancedSequence(tItem,repetition,start_condition)
%
%   Generates a so-called t1r1 sequence, see Aguirre for fMRI applications.
%   These sequences are balanced over second-order transitions.
%
%   TITEM is the total number of conditions. REPETITION is the number of
%   transitions. If REPETITION is equal to 1, all transitions are repeated
%   only once. Therefore the number of total repetitions will depend on the
%   TITEM, this is a necessity of the  constraints characterizing second
%   order balancing. Also note that the total number of elements in the
%   sequence will be TITEM*REPETITION+1, the  +1 is needed to make all
%   transitions possible. START_CONDITION indicates the starting condition
%   of the sequence.
%
%   Example Usage:
%   [S,i]=SecondOrderBalancedSequence(8,ones(1,8)*34,1)
